# Using agent-skills with Antigravity CLI

Antigravity CLI (`agy`) has native support for plugins, skills, and subagents. It can auto-discover and run skills on-demand, or import them globally or per-workspace.

## Setup

### Option 1: Install as a Plugin (Recommended)

Antigravity CLI natively supports the plugin format defined in this repository.

**Install from the remote repository:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
agy plugin install ./agent-skills
```

Once installed, you can list the active plugins to verify:

```bash
agy plugin list
```

### Option 2: Import from Gemini CLI

If you are migrating from Gemini CLI and already had `agent-skills` installed there, you can import it directly:

```bash
agy plugin import gemini
```

This will automatically migrate configuration, skills, and extensions from your old `~/.gemini/` path to your new `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` environment.

## How It Works

### 1. On-Demand Skill Activation
Antigravity CLI automatically discovers the `SKILL.md` files located in the `skills/` directory of the installed plugin. Using the trigger descriptions in each skill's frontmatter, the agent will dynamically activate the appropriate workflow when it detects matching developer intent.

For example, when you ask the agent to:
- **Design a new system** &rarr; It will suggest/activate `spec-driven-development`.
- **Implement a feature** &rarr; It will activate `incremental-implementation` and `test-driven-development`.
- **Fix a bug** &rarr; It will activate `debugging-and-error-recovery`.

### 2. Specialized Agent Personas
The plugin registers reusable subagent definitions from the `agents/` directory:
- `code-reviewer.md`
- `security-auditor.md`
- `test-engineer.md`

You can invoke these personas directly within your session or when delegating tasks using subagents.

## Configuration & Customization

### Project-Specific Enforcements (`AGENTS.md`)
To enforce strict skill compliance (e.g. requiring a spec or plan before writing code), copy or link `AGENTS.md` into the root of your workspace. Antigravity CLI reads this file to align the agent's behavior and planning phase with your team's conventions.

### Sandbox Mode
If you want to run skills or scripts with limited terminal permissions (for safety when running third-party validation tests), launch the CLI with:

```bash
agy --sandbox
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Keep plugins up-to-date:** You can update the CLI or check for newer plugin versions using:
   ```bash
   agy update
   ```
2. **Review before execution:** When agents execute complex refactoring tasks using these skills, use `Ctrl+r` to enter the **Artifact Review** screen to review, edit, or approve code before it is committed.
3. **Control permissions:** You can use the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag only in trusted local projects where you want to bypass manual tool approval prompts.
